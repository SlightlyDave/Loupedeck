# Loupedeck G1000 Plugin

**Please note there is no guarantee this will work and all the steps are done at your own risk** 

Contained here are the Loupedeck files that should allow you to use your G1000 in MSFS 2020

Install steps:

1.  Ensure that you have removed the existing MSFS Plugin from the Loupdeck software, if it has issues you could always try removing it from the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Loupedeck\Plugins folder, alternatively you could un-install the Loupedeck software and remove the folder %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Loupedeck, then re-install it, this means it becomes a fresh install, but **YOU WILL LOOSE EXISTING SETTINGS BY UNINSTALLING / RE-INSTALLING BE WARNED**

2.  Load the either the MSFS.lplug4 or MSFSPluginPackage.lplug4 file

3.  You can then set-up the Loupedeck as you would like it or import the MSFS GA G1000.lp5 profile as a starting place.

4.  Install the MobiFilght connector (needed to allow the plugin to communicate with MSFS) - As of writing this using version 10.0.2

5.  Install / Update the events.txt (Extras -> MSFS2020 -> Update events.txt (Legacy)), after this you might need to also install the "Install WASM Module"

At the moment the PROC button on the MFD menu doesn't appear to work.
